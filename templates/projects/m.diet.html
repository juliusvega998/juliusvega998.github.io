        <h1>Diet Optimizer</h1>
        <p>Diet Optimizer is my CMSC150 project. CMSC150 is a course offered in
        University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os entitled "Numerical and Symbolic Computations."
        The aim of the project is to <span class='emphasis'>implmement Simplex Algorithm to find the optimal diet
        for the user given a list of food</span>. Also, the application should be capable of solve a
        Simplex Problem given a set of constraints and an objective function.</p>
        <p class='tag'>&lt;/introduction&gt;</p>
        <br />
        <p class='tag'>&lt;methodology&gt;</p>
        <p><span class='emphasis'>An Android Application named "Artificial Dietician" successfully implemented the
        project specifications</span>. The application can be used to solve the Simplex problem
        and to find the optimal diet given a list of food. However, the simplex solver
        module of the application assumes that the user inputs the constraints that is
        already in standard form.</p>
