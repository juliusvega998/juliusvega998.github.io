        <p>SystemOne is an online enrollment system in the University of the Philippines </p>
        <p>Los Ba&ntilde;os (UPLB) made by the students themselves. It was regarded as a </p>
        <p>slow website where the student needs to wait at least 5 seconds so that a web page </p>
        <p>will load. There are even cases that the page will not load at all.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Fortunately, <span class='emphasis'>the latest version of SystemOne, codenamed 'Reborn', fixed</span></p>

        <p>We used NodeJS on the server side with MySQL as the database of the website.</p>
