        <h1>SystemOne: Reborn</h1>
        <p>SystemOne is an online enrollment system in the University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os (UPLB)</p>
        <p>made by the UPLB students. It was regarded as a slow website where the student needs to wait at</p>
        <p>least 5 seconds so that a page will load. There are even cases that the page will not load at all. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Fortunately, the latest version of SystemOne, codenamed 'Reborn', fixed all of the issues faced</p>
        <p>by the previous versions of SystemOne.</p>

        <p>We used NodeJS on the server side with MySQL as the database of the website.</p>
        <p>The design uses Materialize CSS Framework and jQuery.</p>
        <p>Amazon Web Service is used to provide the server needed to deploy the website.</p>

        <p>I developed the automated testing of the back-end routes of the website.</p>
        <p>I also managed the website by answering the questions of the students</p>
        <p>who have a hard time using the website.</p>
